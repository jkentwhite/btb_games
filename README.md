# btb_games

this repo is for documentation purposes and is not meant to run on its own.

in 2017, i worked for a startup called "beat the bomb" where I worked as a game designer and
a very, very newbie developer. we worked from paper prototypes in a downtown brooklyn apartment
to two seperate prototype installations, one in bushwick and one in in the current location
of dumbo near the brooklyn bridge. i was new to coding and did not fully understand how to structure
code or which tools to use outside of processing and arduino. though i watched a tutorial and wrote code
for the blobs based on dan shiffman instruction, the logic i came up with to create, display, and match
patterns was all my own. though it may not be the most robust or clean code, i am proud to have figured out how to
create game play and interactivity using improper tools and development environments. perhaps a game engine
would have been more appropriate but i was under a time constraint and determined to use the tools that i had
experience with, even it that experience was very limited to a few class projects and my understanding of
object-oriented programming was...incomplete ate the time.
